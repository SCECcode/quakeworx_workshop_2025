# quakeworx_workshop_2025
Open Science and Research Computing Workshop Notebook for the Quakeworx and Cybertraining workshop.

The most direct way to run the notebooks in this repo is to use a conda environment. The required computing environment is defined in a environment.yml file and notebook environments will load the required libraries. For full images, this repo includes a Dockerfile that includes the required compilers and python libraries.
