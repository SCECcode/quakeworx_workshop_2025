    "- **Earthquake Catalogs**: Databases of earthquake locations, magnitudes, and times (e.g., USGS, IRIS).\n",
    "- **Observed Seismograms**: Time-series data recorded by seismic stations.\n",

    "This Jupyter notebook introduces the basic process of working with open science data by introducing four common steps of data access: Find, Select, Download, and View. These steps are taken when accessing most types of open-science data regardless of the specific data being accesssed, and they align with key principles of the FAIR data guidelines and the broader open science frameworks developed by researchers such as Wilkinson et al. and organizations like Research Data Alliance (RDA), Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP), and DataONE.\n",
